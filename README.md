# Pneumonia_Disease_Detection_Using_Chest_X-Ray_Images_Through_Deep_Learning_Techniques

This repository is a code storage for my Mini Project submission towards department of CSE(AI&ML) @ Vardhaman College of Engineering

## Dataset used : Kaggle Pneumonia Radiology Dataset

The Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset on Kaggle is a crucial resource for training and evaluating machine learning models aimed at pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. It is widely utilized in medical imaging and machine learning communities to develop algorithms that accurately distinguish between normal and pneumonia-affected X-rays. Researchers leverage this dataset to explore machine learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to automate pneumonia diagnosis. The labeled data in this dataset supports robust model training and evaluation, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in clinical settings.
